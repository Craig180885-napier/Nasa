## Turn me into a proper readme

### This is a markdown file.  Markdown is popular for readme files and easy to learn. If you're interested go to [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

Tasks:

Review / Comment / Approve (eventually) / Merge Pull Request
Rebase a branch
Resolve Conflicts (This will be an interesting one as I'm sure GitHub Desktop insists on resolving conflicts via the CLI)
Create a pull request
